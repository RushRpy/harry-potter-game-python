# Harry Potter Game

![](Untitled%20Document.png)

As you can see above in the game map, we first start the game. Then tell the player a story like "You are standing in a dark room. There is a door to your left and right, which one do you take? (l or r)". If the player types "l", then we lead him to the Fluffy Room (Three-Headed Dog), or if he/she types "r", then we lead him to the Monster Room like that. 

You can easily guess how the game works by looking at the map alone.
